# romclean
An incredibly naÃ¯ve set of scripts to tidy up romsets -- attempts to convert a Goodset/TOSEC/No-intro romset to a 1G1R set.

## Installation
  - Clone the scripts into your homedir/bin
  - Make sure that ${HOME}/bin is in your $PATH.
  - You may remove the file extensions if you wish to make the command names cleaner.
  
## Usage
  - cd to the rom directory you want to clean -- this should be a directory containing only roms.
  - **back up this directory** -- these scripts are destructive by design and do not create backups.
  - run "romclean-pass1.sh" -- this indiscriminately deletes all roms containing specific Goodtools tags in their filenames:
    - (PD), [a], [b], [f], [h], (Hack), [o], [p], [t], [T]
  - run "romclean-pass2.py" -- this does not delete anything, as it most likely requires user intervention:
    - This script creates three files: 
      - keep.lis, a file of all the roms to keep based on the heuristics (purely informational)
      - kill.lis, a file of all the roms to kill based on the heuristics
      - error.lis, a file of all the roms that the script couldn't figure out what to do with.
    - Before running pass3, you'll need to edit the error.lis file to ensure it only contains roms you want to delete.
    - You may wish to double check kill.lis to make sure it's not overzealous -- again, make sure it only contains roms you want to delete.
    - The heuristics are:
      - Tier 1: prefer U > UE/EU > UJ/JU > W > E > J.
      - Tier 2: prefer [!] over non-[!].
      - If tiers 1 and 2 provided a list with more than one entry, add all to the error.lis file for the user to figure out.
    - The script is fairly stupid on filename matching -- it splits on the first ., [, or ( encountered in the filename and uses that a a key -- so that "M.A.S.H." and "M.U.L.E" and "M.U.S.C.L.E." all end up matching the key "M", adding them all to the error.lis.  A minor hiccup that I'm not going to fix. 
  - Finally, run "romclean-pass3.sh", which deletes all roms listed in both kill.lis and error.lis.
  - You can then delete the .lis files.

## Support
I will provide no support or bugfixes for these scripts.  They're ugly and fragile and destructive.  Use them at your own risk.
